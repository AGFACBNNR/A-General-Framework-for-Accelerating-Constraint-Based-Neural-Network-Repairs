This repository contains source code and data of paper "A General Framework for Accelerating   Constraint-Based Neural Network Repairs".

The source code of our example selection strategy is under the directory "preProcessing".

The directory "networks" contains the networks used in the experiments.

"PRDNN" and "RIPPLE" contains the source code and results of our experiment on the two methods.

The standard and adversarial training set and test set are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KW0NtbMv5LybBSp3lFqBL5nuj-2LjifP?usp=sharing.

The filtered example set are too large to be in this repository and can be generated with the code in "preProcessing".
